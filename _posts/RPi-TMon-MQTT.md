# Monitoring the Raspberry Pi CPU Temperature with MQTT

The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, and incredibly popular single-board computer that is widely used for a variety of purposes. One thing that is important to consider when using a Raspberry Pi is the temperature of its CPU. If the CPU gets too hot, it can lead to performance issues and even hardware damage.
  
To help prevent these issues, it is a good idea to monitor the CPU temperature of your Raspberry Pi on a regular basis. One way to do this is to use a repository called "RPi-TMon-MQTT" on GitHub. This repository contains a tool that allows you to monitor the temperature of your Raspberry Pi's CPU and send the data to an MQTT server. 

## First things first: What is MQTT?
MQTT (Message Queueing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol that is commonly used in the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows devices to communicate with each other and with a central server by sending and receiving small messages, known as "packets." By using MQTT, you can easily send data from your Raspberry Pi to a central server or other devices on your network. This can be particularly useful if you want to monitor the temperature of your Raspberry Pi remotely or use the data for other purposes, such as triggering an alert if the temperature gets too high.

## Installing and Using RPi-TMon-MQTT
To use the "RPi-TMon-MQTT" tool, you will first need to install it on your Raspberry Pi. This can be done by cloning the repository and then following the instructions provided. Once it is installed, you can configure the tool to connect to your MQTT server and specify the frequency at which the temperature should be measured.

## Benefits of Monitoring the CPU Temperature with MQTT
Monitoring the CPU temperature of your Raspberry Pi with MQTT has several benefits. Firstly, it can help you to identify if the temperature of your CPU is getting too high, allowing you to take corrective action before any damage occurs. This could involve adding additional cooling to your Raspberry Pi, or simply reducing the workload on the CPU to allow it to cool down.

Additionally, by sending the temperature data to an MQTT server, these data can be consumed by several other services like Node-Red or stored to a data base like InfluxDB and presented in a nice looking dashboard with Grafana.
