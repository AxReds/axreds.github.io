As Program Director at Microsoft, I am a highly experienced and goal-driven professional responsible for leading the deployment of Cloud projects as part of the Industry Solutions team at worldwide organizations. 

With over 30 years of experience in the IT market, particularly in customer-facing roles, I have a strong track record of success in complex deals and working with top customers across a variety of industries. I have spent the past 20 years at Microsoft Services, where I have held various consulting positions, including Partner Strategy Consultant, Project Manager, Program Manager, and Engagement Manager. 

I am known for my problem-solving skills and ability to perform well under pressure, as well as my strong communication skills and ability to understand and meet the needs and priorities of customers and partners. In my spare time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
